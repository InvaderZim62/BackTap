# BackTap

"Back Tap" is a feature in iOS 14+ and iPhone 8+.  It can be use to trigger events on the phone, but is not available in code for app development.

I created this app to demonstrate how you can detect taps on the back iPhone in code using the z-accelerometer.

Here is a plot of z-acceleration versus time.  I tapped the back of the phone twice with the screen facing up, and twice with the screen facinf down.
